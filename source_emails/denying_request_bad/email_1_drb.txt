Bad news.

You didn't purchase a warranty with your board, so we can't help you. Feel free to bring it by our repair shop (where normal rates apply) though.

It usually takes us a week to fix boards.

Hi Customer One,

That sucks your board was ruined.

What is the transaction number from your receipt?

Hey!

I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately dented it already. Is there any way the repair can be covered under the warranty? I have the receipt handy.

Thanks!

Customer One
