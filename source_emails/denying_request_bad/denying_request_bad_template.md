Hey!

I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately dented it already. Is there any way the repair can be covered under the warranty? I have the receipt handy.

Thanks!

Hi Customer One,

That sucks your board was ruined.

What is the transaction number from your receipt? I'll ask someone to check our system.

Bad news :(

You didn't purchase a warranty with your board, so we can't help you. Feel free to bring it by
our repair shop (where normal rates apply) though. We have a quick turn around time.
