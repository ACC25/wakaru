Hey!

I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately severely dented it already. Is there any way you can cover the repair cost? I'm not sure if I purchased a warranty or not. I have the receipt handy (transaction #123456789).

Thanks!

*Customer One*

Hi Customer One,

That really sucks your board was damaged :(

It doesn't look you purchased a warranty with your board, so we can't help you. Feel free to bring it by our repair shop (where normal rates apply) though. We have a quick turnaround time.

Have a good day.

Hey Customer One,

That's really unfortunate you damaged your board.

Bad news. We cannot cover the cost of the repair -- company policy. We have plenty of rentals you can choose from while you wait for your board to be repaired though.
