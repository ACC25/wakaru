Hey!

I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately dented it already. Is there any way the repair can be covered under the warranty? I have the receipt handy.

Thanks!

Hi Customer One,

I'm sorry to hear your board was dented, that is very frustrating.

Could you provide me with the transaction number on the receipt? I will check
our system and let you know what the warranty policy on your board is.

Thank you for taking the time to email us.

Hi Customer One,

Unfortunately we cannot cover the cost of the repair, but we will
gladly expedite the repair of your board.

Are you able to bring the board to our repair shop sometime this week?
We will work as hard as we can to get it back to you as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience and let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.
