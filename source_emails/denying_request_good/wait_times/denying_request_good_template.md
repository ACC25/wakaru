Hi Customer Service One,

I was referred to your shop by a friend who recently purchased a custom board and is very happy with the end product. I am in the market for a new 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and was wondering what your wait times look like? I am going on a surf trip in 10 weeks that I'd love to have the board for it.

I have the time to meet next week, to discuss design, but am very busy after that.

Thank you for your help!

*Customer One*

Good afternoon Customer One,

I'm happy to hear that your friend is enjoying their new board!

I've checked with our designers and unfortunately we cannot meet the 10 week deadline
for your trip due to high demand. Right now we require around 12 weeks to complete custom
orders.

Are you able to meet next Tuesday for roughly 30 minutes at 1300? We will use
that time to discuss design and show you the overall process.

Let me know your thoughts and we apologize for causing any inconveniences.

Hi Customer One,

Our team is excited your friend enjoyed his new board enough to recommend us!

We are sorry to say that we cannot meet your 10 week deadline. Our turn
around time is about 12 weeks for custom orders right now.

We would be happy to meet next week to discuss design ideas, if you are comfortable
receiving the board after your trip. Is there any day in particular that works
for you?

We also have long-term rentals if you are looking to have a different board for
your trip -- as an alternative. 

Thank you for taking the time to contact us.
