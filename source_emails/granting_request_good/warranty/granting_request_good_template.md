Hey!

I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately severely dented it already. Is there any way you can cover the repair cost? I'm not sure if I purchased a warranty or not. I have the receipt handy (transaction #123456789).

Thanks!

Good news Customer One!

I checked in our system and although you did not purchase a warranty plan
last week, we want to offer you a complementary repair since your board is
so new. You can drop the board off at our shop anytime this week and we will
get it back to you as soon as possible.

Stay safe out there!
