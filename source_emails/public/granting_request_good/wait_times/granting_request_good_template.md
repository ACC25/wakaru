Hi Customer Service One,

I was referred to your shop by a friend who recently purchased a custom board and is very happy with the end product. I am in the market for a new 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and was wondering what your wait times look like? I am going on a surf trip in 10 weeks that I'd love to have the board for it.

I have the time to meet next week, to discuss design, but am very busy after that.

Thank you for your help!

*Customer One*

Good afternoon Customer One,

I'm happy to hear that your friend is enjoying their new board!

I've checked with our designers and they can fit you in for a consultation next
Tuesday for roughly 30 minutes at 1300. They ask you have all your design considerations
ready for that meeting, as it will make the whole process easier.

Usually we like to have around 12 weeks for special orders, but we are confident
we can meet your 10 week deadline.

We can't let you leave on a trip without a new board!

Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.

Hi Customer One,

Our team is excited your friend enjoyed his new board enough to recommend us!

We will be on a tight schedule to meet the 10 week deadline, but our designers are
confident they can make it happen. Are you able to meet next Tuesday for roughly
30 minutes at 1300? We will use that time to discuss design and show you the overall process. 

Let me know if that time works and thank you for contacting us.
