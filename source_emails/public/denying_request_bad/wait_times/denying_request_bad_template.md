Hi Customer Service One,

I was referred to your shop by a friend who recently purchased a custom board and is very happy with the end product. I am in the market for a new 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and was wondering what your wait times look like? I am going on a surf trip in 10 weeks that I'd love to have the board for it.

I have the time to meet next week, to discuss design, but am very busy after that.

Thank you for your help!

*Customer One*

Good afternoon Customer One,

How exciting your friend is enjoying his board!

I'm sorry to say we can't take any new orders right now. We are swamped :(

We should have time to meet when you are back from your trip and we can discuss
design ideas.

Hey Customer One,

Unfortunately we cannot meet your 10 week deadline and won't be taking any new
orders for several weeks.

If you could email us back then, we'll probably have a different answer for you.
