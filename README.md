## Introduction

Curating user experiences has become central to many industries in the digital age, where presenting a unified story, across company and product, is central to a holistic marketing strategy. Customer Service represents one of the pillars of business and controlling a user’s experience in that area is important to presenting a unified front. 

With the emergence of accessible natural language processing technologies, such as IBM’s Watson Tone Analyzer, companies can now track the language and tone of their front-facing employees — such as customer service agents. 

This project is focused on developing methodologies to manage the data received from these natural language processing programs, in such a way as to infer whether front-facing employees are contributing to the story of a business or hurting its overall brand.

Wakaru, the tone analyzer app, aims to present these conclusions to businesses in an easy to understand manner.
